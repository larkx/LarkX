NOTE:

The source code of this software was originally released into the public domain
(see licenses/UNLICENSE.md). However, since this software incorporates code
licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) in the libraries/fc
submodule, and since this software links the readline library licensed under the
GNU General Public License (GPL), this is legally questionable if not
impossible.

Additionally, this software package incorporates various pieces of code licensed
under the BSD or MIT licenses and their variants. This adds the additional
requirement of mentioning the respective authors and licenses in binary
distributions as well. Obviously, these licenses must also be kept in the
source.

The only option really is to license the whole package under the AGPL as
follows, with the additional BSD / MIT licenses listed at the end of this file:

The following additional terms have to be published along with binaries
of this software. Some of these may be used in the form of dynamically linked
libraries distributed separately, most notably leveldb and libudt. In that case,
the respective licenses do not apply to the binary of this software.
Also, some of the files are only used for building binaries of this software,
without becoming an actual part of those binaries. Their respective licenses
also do not apply to the binaries.
