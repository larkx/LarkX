LarkX
======================================================

Originally invented as a means to create a fair initial distribution for the
[BitShares (BTS) DAC](https://dacsunlimited.com/), LarkX has matured and is now a
currency on its own. The [objectives and core values](http://forum.larkx.com/index.php)
of the new LarkX are

* simplicity - LarkX is delegated proof of stake (DPOS). It is a pure
  implementation of the core DPOS protocol without the application-specific
  functionality of the many profitable DACs that will be built on top of it. In
  this way, LarkX is the foundation layer of the BitShares ecosystem.

* openness - LarkX is not only open-source, but also open strategy. LarkX
  promotes open development and contribution to the BitShares platform by third
  party developers and investors. At the same time, LarkX is agnostic to the
  features, technology, and business strategy of any particular DAC that is
  built on top of it. LarkX is the Switzerland of DACs.

* collaboration - LarkX will be built with extensibility and collaboration in
  mind. In addition to serving as the common core of profitable DACs, LarkX will
  also serve as a launching pad and resource for developers of new DACs. In this
  way, any contribution to LarkX is a contribution to the BitShares ecosystem. The
  mantra of LarkX is: easy-to-use, easy-to-build, and easy-to-fork.

* stability - LarkX is a stable, non-inflationary, and fairly distributed token.
  LarkX is not a business and is not designed with the objective of maximizing
  profit. As the business environment changes, application-specific DACs will
  have to evolve to maintain their competitive advantage. LarkX may also evolve,
  but only with a slow and steady hand that serves the interest of LarkX holders
  and these core values.
